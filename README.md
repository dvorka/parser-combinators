parser-combinators
==================

A Prolog library of parser combinators.


DESCRIPTION
===========

Parser is a program which does processing of a liner source text. It analyzes structure
of the text and converts it to an output format. One of the options for creation 
of parsers is their bottom-up creation. A parser for the analysis of complex 
structures is created by combinining parsers for simpler parts.

Parser Combinators is a library of parsers and their combinators that supports efficient
creation of parsers for new formats and lanuguages.
