parser-combinators
==================

A Prolog library of parser combinators.


DESCRIPTION
===========

A parser is a program that breaks data into smaller elements for easy translation into
another format. A parser takes input in the form of a sequence of tokens or program 
instructions and builds a data structure in the form of a parse tree or another output
format.One of the options for creation of parsers
is their bottom-up creation. A parser for the analysis of complex structures is created by
combinining parsers for simpler parts.

Parser Combinators is a library of parsers and their combinators that supports efficient
creation of parsers for new formats and lanuguages.
